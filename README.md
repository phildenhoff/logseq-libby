# Libby plugin for Logseq

Import your notes from Libby into Logseq.

## How to

1. [Export your Reading Data from Libby as a JSON file](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6151.htm)
  a. You can use [Libby on the web](https://libbyapp.com)
2. Get the JSON file onto your computer running Logseq with this plugin (if it isn't there already)
3. Press the Book icon to open the plugin
4. Select the libby-export JSON file you just got
5. You should see a preview of your highlights & any notes you took. If this looks good, import!
6. You can rename & reorganize the notes at will. You'll need to delete the file (or blocks) if you want to re-import the reading journey.
